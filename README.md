Background

The convergence of generative artificial intelligence (genAI), quantum computing, and advanced cryptographic protocols
presents transformative opportunities in healthcare and education. As medical education evolves to incorporate AI-driven
tools, the integration of model context protocols (MCPs) with post-quantum cryptography (PQC) offers a promising
framework for secure, adaptive, and personalized learning environments. MCPs represent the progression of genAI towards
agentic behavior, with seamless integration between AI systems and external data sources by providing a universal
standard for connecting AI models to diverse tools and datasets. By establishing structured interactions between AI
models and external systems, MCP facilitates dynamic adaptation to specific contexts, such as medical education or
enterprise workflows. This protocol allows AI systems to preserve context across multiple tools, ensuring continuity and
relevance in their responses. At the heart of the MCP’s impact is its ability to foster agentic AI—autonomous systems
capable of executing tasks on behalf of users while maintaining context. This is achieved through two-way communication
between AI clients and MCP servers, where the servers provide specialized resources, tools, or prompts tailored to
specific tasks. For instance, in medical education, MCP could enable virtual patient simulations by connecting AI models
to clinical databases, curriculum repositories, and assessment tools. These simulations would allow students to practice
decision-making in controlled environments while dynamically adapting scenarios based on their performance. Another
critical aspect of MCP is its emphasis on scalability and interoperability. Developers can build modular AI applications
that adapt to new use cases without requiring extensive retraining or rewriting of application logic. This reusability
is further enhanced by pre-built MCP servers for popular platforms like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, and Postgres. By
standardizing interactions through JSON-RPC workflows, MCP simplifies development processes and reduces maintenance
overhead. It essentially acts as the "USB-C" of AI integration—providing a universal connector for diverse systems.
